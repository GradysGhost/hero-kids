===== The Story Itself =====

Welcome to Rivenshore, a wonderful town in the Brecken Vale nestled among the Druinhowe Mountains. The Camarva River runs down out of cold mountain springs, through Rivenshore, and out to the sparkling Bay of Baylay.

Rivenshore would be a beautiful place to live if it weren't beset by endless calamity. And while their clan's warriors and warlocks are off protecting the Brecken Vale from wild animals, bandits, and dragons, it's up to the kids to deal with any emergencies!

And because the town needs the kids' help, the kids get to training early! Each spring, kids who've come of age report to Master Preben at the Rivenshore Academy for sorting!
