===== The Story Itself =====

==== 1. ====
Welcome to Rivenshore, a wonderful town in the Brecken Vale nestled among the Druinhowe Mountains. The Camarva River runs down out of cold mountain springs, through Rivenshore, and out to the sparkling Bay of Baylay.

Rivenshore would be a beautiful place to live if it weren't beset by endless calamity. And while their clan's warriors and warlocks are off protecting the Brecken Vale from wild animals, bandits, and dragons, it's up to the kids to deal with any emergencies!

And because the town needs the kids' help, the kids get to training early! Each spring, kids who've come of age report to Master Preben at the Rivenshore Academy for sorting! Our teachers have reminded us every day about Sorting Day, so it's always on my mind.

I'm Pyramus Lam. As of today, I am ten years old, and today is the day I see Master Preben. It's a very big day for me, so I'm very nervous. In my dreams, he tells me I'll be a warrior, brave and strong! But what if he tells me I'm better as an arrow-slinging ranger? Or what if he makes me become a warlock? I don't have a lick of magic in me! Oh, I sure hope I get to become a warrior and swing a sword and wear a suit of shining armor!

==== 2. ====
It's a cool, springtime morning. The wind blows through my hair as I approach Rivenshore Academy. Inside the main hall, I take my place in line. Five of the other kids from my class are already waiting. I am number six. Hey! I know the girl in front of me! It's Bosni Irilith, a girl from class who could make water do strange, magical things.

"Hey, Bosni!" I whisper.

She turns around and smiles at me. "Hiya, Pyramus! Beat you here!"

I ask her, "Are you as nervous as I am?"

"No," she says, "Master Preben always says he wants us to be ourselves, so I know he'll make me a water warlock."

"I want to be a warrior, but I'm scared I'm not strong enough!"

"Don't worry," Bosni assures me, "If you want to be a warrior, just act like a warrior, and Master Preben will make you a warrior!"

Then, a mocking voice comes from behind me. How could I not notice the arrival of Ruzus Gongo, the biggest bully at Rivenshore Academy? "Yeah, just act like a warrior even though you're not one!" he jibes at me. I spin to see not just big, mean Ruzus, but also Zezialica Cremmender, who is probably the nicest kid at school.

Zez speaks up: "Ruzus, you and Pyramus may have more in common than you think. Maybe you shouldn't mock him."

"This wimp?" says Ruzus. "He wouldn't last a day in warrior training!"

"You just wait and see, Gongo," interrupts Bosni.

Zez makes an ugly face as Bosni, as just then, a giant door in front of us opens, and through it steps Master Prebus himself. He is very tall, and wearing a dark shroud over his broad shoulders. Everyone snaps to attention, even Ruzus.

After a long pause, Master Prebus began. "Since days long past, it has been tradition in our lovely town of Rivenshore to decide which path of training each child shall pursue. Today is the day you become warrior or warlock, ranger or rogue, hunter or healer. I am to decide your training upon your skill. We begin at the front of the line."

Master Prebus leads the first kid in line through the doorway. One by one, he takes us each back. Some kids are with Master Prebus for a long time. Others take only a few minutes. I don't see anyone looking sad leaving the room, and that gives me hope. Eventually, Bosni is led back. "Good luck," I say as the door closes behind her.

"Warriors don't say, 'Good luck,'" whispers Ruzus. He tries to elbow me in the ribs, but I'm too fast for him. I duck under, and he falls to the ground under his own weight.

I snicker at him at first. "Serves you right!" But then I help him back to his feet. A teacher standing in the corner glares at both of us. A few minutes later, Bosni comes back into the main hall, hardly able to hide her giddiness. Master Prebus is right behind her, no emotion in his face at all. The teacher in the corner beckons to Master Preubs, then whispers something in his ear. Master Prebus nods, then looks right at me.

"Pyramus Lam?" he says. I step toward him.

I hear Ruzus mock me: "Good luck!"

Master Prebus leads me into a large, empty room. Empty, except for three other teachers who I don't recognize.

"Pyramus," he asks me, "What do you hope to become in your future?"

I'm very nervious. My palms are sweaty. I'm suddenly hungry, and all I can think about is Mom's pasta and tomato sauce. Firmly, I grunt, "A warrior!"

"A warrior?" he says, and raises one eyebrow. "What is it important for a warrior to be?"

I puff out my chest and shout, "A warrior must be strong!" Some of the other teachers laugh a little under their breath. Great, now I'm nervous //and// embarrased! I suddenly don't feel as strong.

Master Prebus continues, "A warrior must be strong, yes, but a warrior must also be fast and brave and smart. Above all, a warrior must know right from wrong and must never use his strength for the wrong reason. Pyramus, I've known you for years, since you began coming to school at the Academy, and I've never known you to perform any kind of magic."

"No sir," I respond, "I hope you don't try to make me a warlock!"

For the first time ever, I see Master Prebus crack a smile. "In that time, I have also never known you to be cruel, or to run from cruelty. That shows bravery. I understand Ruzus has been making fun of you in the hall."

"Yes," I say. "Bosni told me to act like a warrior to become a warrior, and Ruzus made fun of us for that."

"A true warrior doesn't have to act like a warrior. He //is// a warrior at heart. And even though he made fun of you, you still helped him up when he fell. That shows great morality in a person your age. For these reasons, I think you would make a wonderful warrior." Master Prebus turns to the other teachers. "Master Chozza, do you concur?"

A man in thick leather armor with a sword on his back steps forward from the group of teachers. "I do concur. Pyramus Lam, you will train with me to become a warrior."

I can hardly contain myself! I'm going to be a warrior! I have so much to learn, but I've never been so excited to learn something!


==== 3. ====
I walk past Ruzus on the way through the main hall, and he gives me an ugly snarl. Outside, Bosni is waiting for me on the stairs. She jumps up with excitement when she sees me.

"How did it go?" she asks.

"It went great!" I say. "I'm going to be a warrior!"

"That's awesome, Pyramus! Congratulations!"

"Are you going to be a water warlock?"

"Of course I am! I always knew I would be."

The Academy door slams open and shut behind us, and out stomps Ruzus looking angry. "What's the matter?" I ask him. "Will you train to be a warrior like me?"

Ruzus frowns and says, "Master Chozza says I'm no warrior, but a brute! Can you believe it?"

And from behind him, the voice of Zezialica, "I can believe it."

Ruzus storms off into town. Bosni, Zez, and I remained on the stairs in the cool spring morning with our futures before us. Next week we would begin training, Bosni as a warlock, Zez (as it turns out) a healer, and me, Pyramus Lam, a warrior!
