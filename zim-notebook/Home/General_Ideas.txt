====== General Ideas ======
Created Thursday 06 September 2018

===== Legos =====

Use Legos to create scenario layouts. Bad guy characters get bad guy Lego avatars. Let the kids pick their Lego avatars. The game rules suggest using [[http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/Heroica|Lego Heroica sets]].

===== Candy as Health =====

I really dig this suggestion from the rulebook:

//One fun way of tracking the health of the heroes and the monsters is to use candy to fill the damage boxes. When a hero damages a monster, that heroâ€™s player can eat the candy. But when a monster damages a hero, the GM gets the treat!//

===== Problem Solving Practice =====

Add elements of problem solving to the game to get Emmett and Spencer to starting doing these things.

===== Dice, Pip Counting, and Value Comparisons =====

The kids should know how to count the pips on a d6.

They need to be able to tell which has more or less. These things can be practiced. This might even fit in with some of Emmett's ABA goals.
