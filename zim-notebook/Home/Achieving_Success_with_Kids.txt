===== Introduce Ideas Over Time Before Playing =====

A roleplaying game has a lot of elements to it. Rather than overwhelm the kids with these things when we sit down to play for the first time, I should introduce them to these elements in various ways before we ever try to play.

==== Swords, Bow & Arrow, Armor, Magic ====

They don't know what this stuff is. That Avengers character uses bow and arrow. Iron Man wears armor. Captain America has a shield. Maybe I can create a frame of reference for fantasy tropes by using superheroes.

==== Storytelling ====

What is a character? Without using the word //plot//, what is plot?

==== World Elements ====

Maybe make up some short stories in the Hero Kids world and tell/read them to the kids a few times to get them familiar with the town and some people they'll meet there.
